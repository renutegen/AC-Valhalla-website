      <h2>Did you know that...</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Born to the Raven Clan of Fornburg in the petty kingdom of Rogaland,
          she was orphaned at a young age and adopted by King Styrbjorn of
          Rogaland, growing up as a younger sister to Sigurd Styrbjornson.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 872, endless warfare and dwindling resources in Norway motivated
          Eivor and Sigurd to lead the Raven Clan in a migration from southern
          Norway to the former Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia in central England,
          founding the settlement of Ravensthorpe along the River Nene (in
          present-day Northamptonshire) in early 873.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eivor ruled the settlement during Sigurd's frequent absences, and he
          built alliances with both Saxon and Danish rulers across England with
          the objective of pacifying the island and making it safe for Norse
          settlement; among his most powerful allies were the sons of Ragnarr
          Lodbrok and the renowned warlord Guthrum.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eivor distinguished herself as a kingmaker who helped to install
          Ceolwulf II of Mercia, Oswald of East Anglia, and Vili Hemmingsson of
          Hellirborg on their thrones, while deposing rival rulers such as
          Burghred of Mercia and Ricsige of Northumbria. In 877, she became Jarl
          of Ravensthorpe after Sigurd voluntarily abdicated in his favor and
          relegated himself to an advisory role in the settlement.
        </li>
        <li>
          In January 878, Eivor completed her pacification of England by joining
          Guthrum's invasion of Wessex - the last of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms -
          and driving King Alfred the Great into exile at the costly Battle of
          Chippenham. Ravensthorpe would continue to grow and prosper under
          Eivor's rule, and her later adventures took her to Ireland and
          Francia, during which she participated in the 885-886 Siege of Paris.
          She ultimately emigrated to Vinland in North America following
          Wessex's unification of England, and she died and was buried in
          present-day Massachusetts in the United States.
